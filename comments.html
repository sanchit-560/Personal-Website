        <h1>Webpage <span>Structure</span></h1>
        <p>The use of the HTML element div provides the framework og the HTML file. Divs help position various of parts of the page.In each page 3 or 4 divs are used according to the requirement of the page</p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>.box1</h3></li>
          <p>The div .box1 is used to contain the navigation bar fpr the website and is used in all of the webpages present in the website.The navigation bar is created using the "nav" tag which consists of the website logo alongside the navigation buttons to the webpages in the website </p>
          <p>The navigation buttons "Home", "Past Experience", "Future" and "Comments" are created using a list.<br>Lastly the use of hyperlinks using "a href" tag helps to access the different webpages in the website.</p>
          <li><h3>.box2</h3></li>
          <p>The div .box2 contains the main content and information in each page such as insights about me, a table which showcases my past experience and my future goals tools. This div contains headings "h1" tags according to the content of the webpage and the rest content are a mixture paragraph "p" tags, ol or ul list tags. All of properties for these tags in this div are defined by the .box2 property in CSS.
            <p>Using this div as class helped me add the content throughout the whole website in a similar manner helping, achieve a consistent structure for the website which is important from an "Aesthetic" point of view.</p>
          <li><h3>#box3</h3></li>
          <p>The div #box3 is used only once in the index page for providing the right space for my profile picture. As the picture the is used only once  the use of id instead of a class is justified as the these properties for a div are not used anywhere else in the website. Like other divs a width of 100% is given to this div, which allows the content to be responsive to the screen size. Lastly all of the properties for the tags in this div are defined by #box3.</p>
          <li><h3>#box4</h3></li>
          <p>This is div is used to provide the links to my social media handles on the very first page and is not repeated throughput the  website, hence an id instead of a class to make this particular div.</p>
          <p>The links in the footer are enclosed inside a list which is further enclosed in a nav tag. Lastly, #box4 is used for defining the properties of the tags in this div.</p>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        <h1>Aesthetics & <span>Design</span></h1>
        <p>Modern day websites use a minimalist and responsive approach approach using interactive methods and simplistic color scheme to engage the users. This website is deigned keeping these very same things in mind. This website does not offer a lot of things in just a page, which could had potentially made the gimmicky and non-interactive</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Color</h3></li>
            <p>Most of this website is designed using very basic HTML and CSS properties such as h1 tags, p tags, images and tables. A color theme of blue gradient is applied throughout the website which changes according to the webpage which helps add simplicity, making the design more pleasing to the eye.</p>
            <li><h3>Font</h3></li>
            <p>The font used throughout the website is Sans Serif, as this font style makes it a lot easier for the user to read the text and are are much easier to read when compared with serif fonts such as Times New Roman</p>
            <li><h3>Interactivity</h3></li>
            <p>The website also uses CSS to actively give feedback to the user as they use the site. This is demonstrated with the help of hyperlinks, where when the user hovers cursor over a hyperlink a change of color is seen which. Such actions helps the user to see wether there actions have been received or not. Lastly the logo designed is embeded with a hyperlink which on clicking takes you too the home page("index.htnml").This further acts as a feature helping improve the user-experience</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        <h1>Accessability</h1>
        <img src="Screenshot_20220928-203517_Chrome.jpg" alt="Screenshot for the webpage on smartphone" id="screenshot">
        <p>The website focuses on being as accessible to the page users as much as possible. Here are some points which makes this exercise more readily accessible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Font Size & Spacing</h3></li>
            <p>Relative font sizes are used for all the elements of the webpage, so that the user won't have any trouble reading the text. Appropriate line and letter spacing is also given which also helps make the text more readable for the user , improving all the over all experience of the website. </p>
            <li><h3>Color Contrast</h3></li>
            <p>It was ensured, that a consistent color contrast is established when designing the aesthetics of the website. As you can see a color contrast is established with blue background and white colored text which does not put strain on the user's eye.</p>
            <li><h3>Screen Readers and Structures</h3></li>
            <p>Throughout the website it is made sure that alt text is specified for each and every image. This is a very important feature as when the images are turned off the alt text will take place of the image, which helps gives some context to the user about that image. Lastly the website retains its structure and is responsive to different screen sizes as shown in the image on the side.</p>
