        <h1>Future<span> Goals</span></h1>
        <p>To be honest, I am currently a bit confused between selecting Data Analytics or Networking and Cybersecurity as my major, but I feel that I will certainly work out through this confusion by the end of this year. </p>
        <p>I have always loved problem solving and I feel choosing any of these fields would provide me with the opportunity to solve real-world problems. I feel that because of my slight inclination and fascination towards Hacking as a field I might choose a my major as Cybersecurity and explore this vast field</p>
        <p>But to be honest, I might have set plans fo myself, but you never really know what the future beholds for you!!!!!!</p>
