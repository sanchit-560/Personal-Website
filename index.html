        <p>Hi there everyone and welcome to my website</p>
        <p>My Name is Sanchit Khosla, and I am an international student studying Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology at UTS</p>
         <p>Playing sports and learning about new technologies are the two things which I enjoy doing the most. Football and Athletics are two sports which are very close to my heart, and I happen to have a decent experiance of playing both of these games. Now if I talk about technology as far as I can remember playing video games was  my first interaction with technology, and ever since it has fascinated me.</p> 
        <p>I started to learn coding after my year 12 final exams and was introduced to Java here at UTS, and to be honest learning Java and new concepts like OOPs and diffrent Data Structures has been a bit challenging journey yet, but the sheer fun having pass all the test-cases at once has kept me motivated so far, so if you have had similar experience the bottom links are for you!!!!</p>
